    <h1>How does the web work?</h1>
    <p>The web is a global system that connects devices worldwide to exchange information over the internet. It operates using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which allows browsers (like Chrome or Firefox) to send requests to servers that store websites. The server processes the request and sends a response containing content such as HTML pages, images, or videos. Websites are built using technologies like HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. This interaction between the client (user) and the server happens through the internet using IP addresses and the Domain Name System (DNS), which translates website names <a href="">(like www.google.com) </a>into numerical addresses.</p>

    <h1>What do you need to become a web developer?</h1>
    <P>To become a web developer, you need a combination of technical skills, tools, and a proactive mindset. Start by learning the foundational web technologies: HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding interactivity. Familiarize yourself with version control systems like Git and tools such as code editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code). As you progress, explore backend technologies like Node.js or Python with frameworks such as Django or Flask, along with databases like MongoDB or MySQL. Knowledge of responsive design principles and frameworks like React or Bootstrap can enhance your ability to build user-friendly interfaces. Additionally, problem-solving skills, a portfolio to showcase your projects, and a commitment to continuous learning are essential to excel in this fast-evolving field.</P>

    <h1>Why did you choose to learn web development? </h1>
    <p>
        I chose to learn web development because it combines creativity with problem-solving, offering the opportunity to build practical solutions and visually appealing designs. The web is an integral part of modern life, and being able to create websites and applications allows me to contribute to this ever-evolving digital world. Web development also provides a flexible career path with diverse opportunities, from freelance work to joining innovative tech companies. Additionally, I enjoy the continuous learning process that comes with mastering new tools, frameworks, and technologies, which keeps the field exciting and dynamic.</p>
